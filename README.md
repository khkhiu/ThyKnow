## Youth Action Challenge (YAC) Project

ThyKnow was a project developed under Singapore's Youth Action Challenge (YAC), a structured six-month programme that empowers youths to champion issues they care deeply about and co-create an inclusive, sustainable and progressive Singapore.

## Project Mission

ThyKnow addresses the growing mental health crisis among Singapore's youth by fostering self-awareness and deeper connections through thought-provoking weekly prompts delivered via a familiar platform - Telegram.

## The Problem We're Solving

- **$16 billion** - The annual cost of depression to Singapore (3% of GDP)
- **64%** of young adults aged 21-34 report feeling isolated at least some of the time
- Young people struggle with meaningful connections despite having more digital connections than ever before
- **64%** of respondents feel isolated by others sometimes/often
- **53%** feel more comfortable talking to people online than in person
- **56%** experience anxiety when engaging in face-to-face interactions

*"Increasing isolation contributes to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, correlating with conditions such as depression and anxiety."* - Johann Hari, author of Lost Connections
